If you live in Toronto and just want to play some pickup hockey at one of the public
rinks near you, it takes a bit too long to figure out where you can play and when. You have 
to pull up the schedule for each rink, find where they list the pickup schedule, and
look through this table.

No longer! Just open this app and you're done.

To set up the app:

    rake db:create db:migrate
    rake scraper:toronto_rinks     # scrapes the data from the rink pages
    rails s
